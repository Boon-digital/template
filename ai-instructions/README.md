This folder contains comprehensive instructions, code snippets, and guidelines for adding content to Sanity through the API. Each subfolder focuses on specific aspects of content management.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **`code-snippets/`** - Reusable code examples for common operations
- **`instructions/`** - Step-by-step guides for specific tasks
- **`edge-cases/`** - Handling unusual scenarios and error conditions
- **`logging/`** - Logging strategies and best practices
- **`testing/`** - Testing approaches for API operations
- **`performance/`** - Optimization techniques and best practices
- **`security/`** - Security considerations and best practices

## üîÑ Workflow Requirements

### Logging Protocol

Every time an instruction or code snippet is used, the following must be logged:

1. **Operation Details**:

   - Date and timestamp
   - Operation type (create, update, delete, query)
   - Target document type and ID
   - Success/failure status
   - Duration (if applicable)
   - Error details (if failed)

2. **Documentation Updates**:

   - Update relevant README files
   - Add new code snippets if created
   - Document any edge cases encountered
   - Update success rates and statistics

3. **Learning Capture**:
   - Document what worked well
   - Note any issues or errors encountered
   - Capture best practices discovered
   - Update troubleshooting guides

## üéØ Recent Learnings

### Hero Layout Change Implementation (2024-12-19)

- **Task**: Change existing hero section layout from 'default' to 'centered'
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed Successfully
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Layout changes are safe and don't affect content structure
  - All existing content (heading, text, buttons, image) is preserved
  - CSS classes automatically handle styling based on layout property
  - Available layouts: 'default', 'centered', 'fullscreen'
  - Simple property updates are more reliable than content modifications

- **Task**: Add second Media & Text section to homepage with CTA functionality
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed Successfully
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Schema validation rules must be added for required fields to ensure data integrity
  - Components must be updated when schema changes to support new functionality
  - TypeScript types must be regenerated after schema modifications
  - CTA fields should be optional but properly validated when present
  - Enhanced code snippets provide better reusability for future tasks

### Media & Text Section Implementation (2024-12-19)

- **Task**: Add Media & Text section to homepage with proper validation
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed Successfully
- **Key Learnings**:
  - SVG content must avoid special characters (like `&`) to prevent XML parsing errors
  - Schema field names must match exactly (`content` vs `text`)
  - Verification queries must include all relevant fields
  - Media & Text sections use `content` field for portable text, not `text`
  - Image position validation ensures proper layout options

### Hero Section Implementation (2024-12-19)

- **Task**: Add hero section to homepage with placeholder content
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed Successfully
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Button URLs must be strings, not boolean values
  - Image fields require proper asset references
  - Section ordering affects frontend display
  - Validation errors appear in Sanity Studio interface
  - Proper error handling for missing documents

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Check `code-snippets/` for reusable examples
2. Follow `instructions/` for step-by-step guides
3. Review `edge-cases/` for common issues
4. Use `logging/` templates for consistent tracking
5. Test with `testing/` approaches before production

## üìù Maintenance
